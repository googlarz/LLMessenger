# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -scheme LLMessenger -configuration Debug build

# Run all tests
xcodebuild -scheme LLMessenger -configuration Debug test

# Run a single test class
xcodebuild -scheme LLMessenger -configuration Debug test -only-testing:LLMessengerTests/BriefEngineTests

# Regenerate Xcode project from project.yml (requires xcodegen)
xcodegen generate
```

The project uses [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) — `project.yml` is the source of truth for project structure. When adding new Swift files, add them to `project.yml` and run `xcodegen generate` rather than editing `project.pbxproj` directly (though both work).

**Database**: In `DEBUG` builds, `eraseDatabaseOnSchemaChange = true` is set — any schema migration change wipes the local DB automatically.

## Architecture

The app is a macOS menu bar app with no storyboards. `AppDelegate` wires all dependencies manually at launch.

### Data flow

```
PollEngine (hourly Timer per service)
    └── MessengerAdapter.fetch()   ← each adapter returns AdapterConversation[]
            │
            ▼
    AppDatabase (GRDB/SQLite)      ← messages stored with briefId = NULL
            │
            ▼
    BriefEngine.processNewMessages()
        1. Compress previous brief via MemoryCompressor → episodicSummary
        2. Build PromptBuilder.build(mode: .summarizer) system prompt
        3. LLMClient.complete() → JSON string (one card per conversation)
        4. Store JSON in Brief.openingSummary
        5. Attach messages to brief (sets briefId)
            │
            ▼
    AppState.refreshBriefs() → notifies SwiftUI via @Published
```

### Key types

- **`MessengerAdapter`** — protocol for each service. `SignalCLIAdapter` reads signal-mcp's SQLite DB and calls its HTTP JSON-RPC API. `SubprocessAdapter` is generic stdin/stdout JSON-RPC for external binaries (used for Telegram).
- **`PollEngine`** — owns the per-service `Timer`s, tracks in-flight polls, writes `ServiceHealth` rows, calls `onPollSucceeded` after each successful poll.
- **`BriefEngine`** — fetches unattached messages (`briefId IS NULL`), calls the LLM in `eager` privacy mode, creates a `Brief` row, attaches messages.
- **`BriefRepository`** — all GRDB queries for briefs and messages. Both `BriefEngine` and `AppState` use it.
- **`AppState`** — `@MainActor ObservableObject` holding the brief list, selected brief, and the per-brief `Message[]` cache. Injected as `@EnvironmentObject`.
- **`ChatViewModel`** — `@MainActor ObservableObject` for the AI conversation thread (Q&A + reply drafting). `ThreadItem` is an enum: `.message`, `.assistantResponse`, `.replyDraft`.

### LLM output format

`PromptBuilder.suffix(for: .summarizer)` asks the LLM to return **JSON only** — no markdown fences. The schema is a `BriefJSON` with a `cards` array of `BriefCard`. `BriefProseView` decodes `brief.openingSummary` as `BriefJSON`; if decoding fails it falls back to rendering the raw text as markdown.

### LLM provider selection (AppDelegate.makeLLMClient)

1. Anthropic key in Keychain → `AnthropicClient`
2. OpenAI key in Keychain → `OpenAIClient`  
3. Neither → `OllamaClient` (model from `UserDefaults["ollama_model"]`)

API keys are stored in the system Keychain via `KeychainStore`. Signal account number is stored in `UserDefaults` (intentionally — avoids macOS permission prompts on rebuilt binaries).

### UI structure

`ChatWindowController` (NSPanel) hosts a SwiftUI `ContentView` split into:
- `BriefListView` — sidebar, grouped by date
- `ChatPanelView` — single `ScrollView` containing `BriefHeaderView` + `BriefProseView` + AI thread items + `ChatInputView` pinned at bottom

`Theme.swift` defines the Anthropic-style dark palette. All colours live there — do not hardcode colours elsewhere.

### Adding a new service adapter

1. Create a class conforming to `MessengerAdapter` in `Core/Adapters/`
2. Register it in `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` with `engine.register(adapter:config:)`
3. Add a `ServiceConfig.default(for:)` case in `ServiceConfig.swift`
4. Add colour + display name in `Theme.serviceColor` / `Theme.serviceName`

### Privacy modes

Each `ServiceConfig` has `privacyMode`: `"on_demand"` (LLM only runs when user explicitly requests) or `"eager"` (LLM runs on every poll). `BriefEngine` only calls the LLM when all fetched services are `eager`.

S222 Reviewed remaining work from PRD-aligned plan for inbox briefing product (May 6 at 8:36 PM)
**Investigated**: Full feature implementation status across seven major areas: trust UI, above-the-fold prioritization, autoreplay logic, conversation memory, partial-failure UX, performance validation, and user research instrumentation

**Learned**: Project is 70-80% complete with solid architectural foundations. Backend safety and brief grounding are strong, but the final trust layer, prioritization polish, and performance validation are blocking full PRD alignment. The gap is primarily in product-facing behavior and user confidence signals, not core capability.

**Completed**: Sources storage with citation counts; continuity state for conversation context; generation state tracking for partial failures; prompt capping and structural constraints; card sorting by priority; safer architecture with better safety patterns

**Next Steps**: Seven priority areas identified: (1) complete trust UI with expandable source previews and message navigation, (2) refine above-the-fold prioritization for urgency signaling, (3) build autoreplay with importance thresholding, (4) extend conversation memory with rolling context and entity tracking, (5) improve partial-failure messaging and degraded-mode UX, (6) profile performance on large real-world inboxes and add cost telemetry, (7) add user research instrumentation with event logging and success metrics
